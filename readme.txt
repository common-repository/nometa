== Description ==

NoMeta is a new plugin I wrote.
I wrote this plugin after getting to frame #45/tip #25 at this <a href="http://yoast.com/40-wordpress-optimisation-tips/">Yoast.com Presentation</a>.
Basicly this plugin is those 3 lines of code :). I thought Ill make life easier for people, so they dont need to retype those lines and try to insert them into WordPress in some way.

1. Upload the `nometa` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it, the plugin is now working & running.
